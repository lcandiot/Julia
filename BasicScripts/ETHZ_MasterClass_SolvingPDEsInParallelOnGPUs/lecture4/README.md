# 2D Porous Convection solvers
Different techniques have been developed to solve the 2D Porous Convection problem. These include explicit/implicit treatment of temperature time integration and the implementation of boundary conditions for temperature. Dirichlet or Neumnann boundary conditions can be implemented either on the fluxes, i.e, exactly at the domain boundary, or on temperature at the first cell center, i.e., at dx/2 | dy/2 distance from the domain boundary. The video below shows Porous Convection in 2D, solved fully implicitly with boundary conditions defined on the fluxes.
